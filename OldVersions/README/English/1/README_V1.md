`ℹ️🚧️🌊️ Information about Git workflows usage in seanpm2001 projects. See also: seanpm2001:GitHub-actions`

## Git workflows

Git workflows are used in my projects. So far, none have expanded past GitHub, so there is no information to present here. GitLab information is coming in the future.

For further information, see [:octocat: `GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub-Actions/)

🌱️ **This [`README.md`](/README.md) file is a major stub and needs significant expansion.**
